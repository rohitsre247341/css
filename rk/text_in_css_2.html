    <p>As the author, you know why one paragraph relates to the next, because you’ve put a lot of effort, research, and thought into the planning of this document. Your reader isn’t as well-versed in the subject as you are, however. Adding transition words and phrases helps cue your reader into the connections between ideas you’ve already made for yourself.
